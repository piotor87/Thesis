For centuries, the primary focus of science was mainly on natural events, but as the new technologies allowed to gather data from human interactions, it was natural for scientists to use this new information in order to apply the same logic to social systems, including science itself.</p><p class="Body_Abstract_First"><br data-mce-bogus="1"></p><p class="Body_Abstract_First">Since the late 18th century, when the first modern scientific journals were first published, science has seen a constant rise in both its size and productivity, thanks to the standardization of research standards and the building of an international community that actively helps to push forward the limits of human knowledge. As science itself went from being a purely intellectual endavour to a complex social,economical and political system, it is no surpirse that a lot of attention has been dedicate in recent years to the study of the underlying mechanisms of science, aided by the explosion of means of communication that allow collaborations and exchange of information at instant speed across the globe, leaving behind digital traces that provide valuable data to study. The continuous exponential growth of science however, causes also difficulties in analyzing objectively the patterns and statistics that scientific data can reveal: for example a paper from the early 19th century would rarely get more than 100 citations, while now it is not uncommon for publications to pass the 10 thousand citation mark. This shows that science is a living system, the evolution of which needs to be taken into account in the analysis process.</p><p class="Body_Abstract_First"><br data-mce-bogus="1"></p><p class="Body_Abstract_First">This thesis follows these attempts in trying to grasp how science works, by investigating the connections, i.e. citations, that exists between scientific publications and how these connections create structures and patterns. </p></body></html>
