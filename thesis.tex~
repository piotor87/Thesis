This thesis is the product of the work started at BECS in winter 2013 and eventually 
completed at the CS department in the summer of 2017. 

Looking back at these 4 years it's an interesting and exciting dive into
a lot of moments that have influenced heavily my life both privately as well as professionally.
Moving to Finland to pursue my academic passion was not just a big step forward in my career, but also
a big leap into a new world of which I admit I knew very little about beforehand. The first days were
therefore often as exciting as well as confusing and I need to thank the whole staff working at BECS
at the time for keeping an eye on me. In particular I'd like to mention Lauri Kovanen, who showed me 
the ways of the Python, Arnab Chatterjee and Marija Mitrovi\'c, with whom I often discussed about Science
in general, Raj Kumar Pan and Richard Darst, who had the patience to help me with often small
technical issues that I was not able to overcome on my own. Also, a huge thanks goes to my doctoral office mate, Darko Hric,
with whom I shared all the ups and downs of this adventure.

Leaving BECS was a huge change from many aspects. Most of the senior staff in the meantime had decided
to leave Aalto, ultimately leading to the departure also of my superivsor, Prof. Santo Fortunato,
whom I thank for guiding me and making me understand the pros and cons of life in academia. 
This period was extremely hectic, especially also with the organziation of the iccss conference, which
unfortunately does not show up as part of this dissertation, but which is one of my proudest contribution
to Science, given the amount of work required and the quality of the final product, for which
Prof. Fortunato. This period culminated with yet another move to a new office within the CS department,
which represented the final stage of my stay at Aalto, now with the supervision
of Dr. Mikko Kivel\"a and Prof. Kimmo Kaski, to whom I owe a huge amount of gratitued
for "adopting" me in the final stage of my PhD and allowing me to conclude a project that turned out
to be both exciting and productive. Prof. Kaski was not only an excellent scientific
guide, but also a key figure in terms of supporting me, both personally and professionally,
until the very end of my experience at Aalto.

Finally, a big thanks to all those who have had the unfortunate experience
of being around me during my studies, but withouth whose support I wouldn't have been
able to get this far.
